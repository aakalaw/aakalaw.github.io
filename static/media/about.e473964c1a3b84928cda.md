# Some Saying

- I always make a to-do list every day. The real challenge is finding someone ambitious enough to do it for me!

# Stories

I usually tell my stories in person because I'm a bit shy about sharing them online. But I’d love to connect with you all through these stories and hear your thoughts!

# I like

- Sudoku (because who doesn't love feeling both smart and confused at the same time?)
- Guitar (it's like therapy, but with more strings)
- Bicycle (for when you want to travel quickly and sweat profusely)
- Karaoke (where tone-deafness becomes a superpower)
- Billiards (because geometry should be this fun!)

# Fun facts

- I like to think of myself as a chef, though my specialty is a hard-boiled egg that's more metaphorical than edible!
- If I could choose any superpower, it would be time manipulation. This would let me pause time to catch up on tasks, rewind to fix mistakes, fast-forward through dull moments, and even travel to different historical eras.

# I dream of

- Finding joy in the act of motivating and uplifting those around me.
- Contributing to a better world for everyone, regardless of their political or socioeconomic status.
- Showing heartfelt respect and compassion to every individual I encounter.
- Maintaining a curious mind and a thirst for knowledge.
- Consistently striving for improvement.
- Relentlessly hunting for answers, even when “Google it” or “ChatGPT it” is the obvious choice.
