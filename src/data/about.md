# Saying

- I always make a to-do list every day. The real challenge is finding someone ambitious enough to do it for me!

# History

- Karl Marx famously quipped, "History repeats itself: first as tragedy, second as a farce. Third time's a charm, though, right?"

You can personally ask me about stories that I'm too afraid to share on the internet.

# I like

- Sudoku (because who doesn't love feeling both smart and confused at the same time?)
- Guitar (it's like therapy, but with more strings)
- Bicycle (for when you want to travel quickly and sweat profusely)
- Karaoke (where tone-deafness becomes a superpower)
- Billiards (because geometry should be this fun!)

# Fun facts

- My dream vacation with my family is to travel to Japan and experience the breathtaking beauty of cherry blossoms in full bloom.
- I fancy myself a chef; my signature dish is a hard-boiled egg that's more metaphorical than edible.
- If I could have any superpower, I would choose the ability to manipulate time. With this power, I could pause time to catch up on tasks or evade trouble, rewind to correct mistakes, fast-forward through tedious moments, and even journey to different periods in history.

# I dream of

- Filled with inspiration and experiencing the joy of inspiring others.
- Empowering a better future for all, irrespective of political or socioeconomic backgrounds.
- Showing sincere kindness and respect to each person.
- Remaining inquisitive.
- Consistently striving for improvement.
- Always asking questions, even when the answer is clearly "Google it".
